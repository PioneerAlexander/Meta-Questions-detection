# Meta-Questions-detection

Meta-questions are questions that reflect on the process of questioning, rather than seeking specific information or a direct answer. In other words, meta-question is a question that implies other questions like:

- May I ask a question?
- Is there anyone experienced in N?
- Has anyone here taken a course from Google on Coursera? I have a text analysis question...
- Guys, I have a question about %framework_name%

Refer to [official website](https://nometa.xyz) for more detailed information about meta-questions.

In this project we investigate how modern classification model, such as DistilBERT, performs on the problem of Meta-question detection.
